**Lecture Content Highlights:**

1. **Rotation Representations (from notes dated 9/16 and 9/18):**
   - Rotation matrices (SO(3)) are 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant +1.
   - Euler angles: 3 rotations about axes; 12 possible sequences (6 permutations of X, Y, Z and 6 with repeated first and third axes). Important to specify order and frame (fixed or current).
     - Example: Z-Y′-X′′ Euler angles with rotation matrix composition Rz(α)Ry′(β)Rx′′(γ).
     - Euler angles suffer from gimbal lock (loss of one degree of freedom at singularities, e.g., β=π/2).
   - Axis-angle representation: rotation by angle θ about unit axis k̂.
     - Rotation matrix formula given for arbitrary axis.
     - Conversion from rotation matrix to axis-angle via θ = arccos((trace(R)-1)/2) and axis from skew-symmetric part.
     - Ambiguity at θ=0 (no rotation) and θ=π (sign ambiguity).
     - Axis-angle can be compressed into a 3-vector v = θk̂.
     - No simple composition rule for axis-angle vectors.
   - Quaternions: 4D vectors (q0, q1, q2, q3) representing rotations, unit norm.
     - Quaternion for rotation θ about k̂: Q = [cos(θ/2), kx sin(θ/2), ky sin(θ/2), kz sin(θ/2)].
     - Conversion between quaternions and rotation matrices provided.
     - Quaternion multiplication composes rotations; associative, distributive, but not commutative.
     - Rotation of vector p by quaternion Q: p' = Q * p * Q⁻¹ (with p as quaternion [0, x, y, z]).
     - Quaternions avoid gimbal lock and allow smooth interpolation (SLERP).
     - Double cover of SO(3): Q and -Q represent the same rotation.

2. **Properties of Rotation Representations:**
   - Desiderata: dimensional generality, compactness, uniqueness, numerical stability, interpolability, differentiability.
   - Table summary:
     - Angle (2D): compact, unique, stable, interpolable, differentiable.
     - Rotation matrix: general, unique, differentiable; not compact, stable, or interpolable.
     - Euler angles: compact, unique except at singularities; not stable or interpolable.
     - Axis-angle: compact, unique, not stable or interpolable except about axis.
     - Quaternion: general, stable, interpolable, differentiable; not unique (double cover), not compact.
   - Algebraic group properties of rotations (SO(2), SO(3)):
     - Closure, identity, inverse, associativity hold.
     - SO(3) is non-Abelian (rotations do not commute).
     - SO(2) is Abelian (2D rotations commute).
     - Rotation matrices commute if about the same axis.

3. **Robot Kinematics and Rotations (from 9/11 and 9/18 notes):**
   - Bicycle model kinematics: linear and angular velocities, no-slip constraints.
   - 2D rotation matrices and their properties.
   - Homogeneous transforms (SE(3)) combine rotation and translation in 4x4 matrices.
   - Homogeneous transform T = [R p; 0 1], where R ∈ SO(3), p ∈ ℝ³.
   - Composition of transforms corresponds to chaining poses.
   - SE(3) is the pose equivalent of SO(3).

### Course Content Summary

**1. Beyond Rotation Matrices: 3D Rotation Representations**

- Rotation matrices have 9 elements but only 3 degrees of freedom due to orthogonality and unit length constraints.
- Alternative 3D rotation representations use only 3 or 4 parameters:
  - **Euler Angles** (α, β, γ): Three sequential rotations about specified axes (fixed or current frame). There are 12 conventions (6 permutations of X, Y, Z axes and 6 with repeated first and third axes).
    - Example: Z-Y′-X′′ Euler angles represented by rotation matrix \( R_{ZY'X''} = R_z(\alpha) R_{y'}(\beta) R_{x''}(\gamma) \).
    - Euler angles suffer from **gimbal lock** (loss of one degree of freedom) at singularities (e.g., β = π/2 for ZY′X′′).
  - **Axis-Angle Representation**: Any rotation can be represented by a unit axis vector \(\hat{k}\) and an angle θ.
    - Basic rotations about principal axes Rx(θ), Ry(θ), Rz(θ) given by standard matrices.
    - For arbitrary axis \(\hat{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)\), rotation matrix \(R_k(\theta)\) is given by Rodrigues' formula (Eq. 13).
    - Conversion from rotation matrix \(R\) to axis-angle:
      - \(\theta = \cos^{-1} \frac{r_{11} + r_{22} + r_{33} - 1}{2}\)
      - \(\hat{k} = \frac{1}{2 \sin \theta} [r_{32} - r_{23}, r_{13} - r_{31}, r_{21} - r_{12}]^T\)
    - Ambiguities at θ=0 (no rotation) and θ=π (sign ambiguity).
    - Axis-angle can be compressed into a 3-vector \(v = \theta \hat{k}\), but vector algebra does not apply for composition.
  - **Quaternions**: Four-dimensional numbers \(Q = q_0 + q_1 i + q_2 j + q_3 k\) representing rotations.
    - Unit quaternions (\(\|Q\|=1\)) represent rotations: \(Q = [\cos(\theta/2), k_x \sin(\theta/2), k_y \sin(\theta/2), k_z \sin(\theta/2)]^T\).
    - Conversion between quaternions and axis-angle or rotation matrices is provided (Eqs. 20-24).
    - Quaternion multiplication composes rotations (non-commutative but associative and distributive).
    - Rotation of vector \(P_A = [x, y, z]^T\) by quaternion \(Q\) via \(P'_A = Q \cdot [x, y, z, 0]^T \cdot Q^{-1}\).
  
**2. Properties of Rotation Representations**

- Important properties for robotics software:
  - Dimensional generality (support 2D and 3D)
  - Compactness (minimal data size)
  - Uniqueness (one representation per rotation)
  - Numerical stability (robust to floating point errors)
  - Interpolability (smooth interpolation between rotations)
  - Differentiability (smooth rate of change representation)
  
| Representation | Generality | Compactness | Uniqueness | Numerical Stability | Interpolability | Differentiability |
|----------------|------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Angle (2D)     | Yes        | No          | Yes        | Yes                 | Yes*            | Yes              |
| Rotation matrix| Yes        | No          | Yes        | No                  | No              | Yes              |
| Euler angles   | Yes (3D)   | Yes*        | Yes        | No                  | No              | No               |
| Axis-angle     | Yes (3D)   | Yes         | Yes        | No†                  | No†              | No               |
| Quaternion     | Yes (3D)   | No‡         | No         | No                  | Yes             | Yes              |

*Euler angles and axis-angle fail at discrete singularities; quaternions are a double cover of SO(3).

**3. Algebraic Properties of Rotations**

- Rotations form groups under composition:
  - SO(2) in 2D (Abelian, commutative)
  - SO(3) in 3D (non-Abelian, non-commutative)
- Group properties: closure, identity, inverse, associativity.
- 2D rotation matrices commute; 3D rotation matrices commute only if about the same axis.

  - Build packages with `catkin build` inside `/src` directory.
  - Use `rospack find <package>` to locate packages.
  - Use `roscd <package>` to change directory to package.
  - Use `rosls <package>` to list package contents.

- **Basic ROS Components:**
  - Nodes: Executables performing computation.
  - Master: Manages node communication.
  - Topics: Named channels for message exchange.
  - Messages: Typed data structures.
  - Parameter Server: Shared dictionary for runtime parameters.
  - Services: Request-response communication.

- **Publisher/Subscriber Model:**
  - Publisher node sends messages on a topic.
  - Subscriber node receives messages and processes via callback.
  - Asynchronous communication.
  - Example Python publisher:
    ```python
    import rospy
    from std_msgs.msg import String
    def talker():
        pub = rospy.Publisher('chatter', String, queue_size=10)
        rospy.init_node('talker', anonymous=True)
        rate = rospy.Rate(10)  # 10hz
        while not rospy.is_shutdown():
            hello_str = "hello world %s" % rospy.get_time()
            rospy.loginfo(hello_str)
            pub.publish(hello_str)
            rate.sleep()
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        try:
            talker()
        except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
            pass
    ```
  - Example Python subscriber:
    ```python
    import rospy
    from std_msgs.msg import String
    def callback(data):
        rospy.loginfo(rospy.get_caller_id() + "I heard %s", data.data)
    def listener():
        rospy.init_node('listener', anonymous=True)
        rospy.Subscriber("chatter", String, callback)
        rospy.spin()
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        listener()
    ```

- **Services & Clients:**
  - Service node performs task on request and returns response.
  - Client node sends request and waits for response.
  - Use case example: robot querying voice assistant.

- **Parameter Server:**
  - Stores parameters accessible by nodes at runtime.
  - Use `rosparam` CLI to list, get, set, delete parameters.

- **ROS Master:**

    roslaunch husky_navigation planner.launch
    ```
  - `.launch` files can include parameters and other launch files.

- **ROS Environment Variables:**
  - `ROS_ROOT`, `ROS_MASTER_URI`, `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`, `ROS_IP`/`ROS_HOSTNAME`.

- **Visualization & GUI:**
  - RViz: 3D visualization tool.

**CS 4750 Foundations of Robotics (2025FA) - Summary**

**Course Materials & Notes:**

- **Kinematics and Rigid Bodies (Introduction_Kinematics_RigidBodies.pdf)**
  - Kinematics studies robot motion via geometry: positions, angles, and their rates of change (velocity).
  - Two main robot forms:
    - Mobile robots: locomote on ground using wheels (drive wheels, free-spinning wheels, casters).
      - Drive mechanisms: differential drive (e.g., Roomba), bicycle steering, Ackerman steering (typical cars).
    - Manipulator arms: serial chain of rigid links connected by joints (revolute joints rotate about an axis; prismatic joints slide along an axis).
      - Joints constrain motion except in one direction (degree of freedom).
  - Actuators (mostly electric motors) produce motion; sensors detect physical properties.
    - Proprioceptive sensors: encoders (joint position), torque sensors.
    - Exteroceptive sensors: imaging sensors (cameras, RGB+D), range finders (sonar, LIDAR).
  - Rigid-body abstraction: models robot links or bodies as undeformable solids.
    - Position and orientation of rigid bodies described relative to reference frames.
    - Position vectors \( P^G_A \) denote point A’s coordinates in global frame {G}.
    - Rigid body motion = translation + rotation; any sequence of these can be combined into a single translation and rotation.
    - Translation represented as a vector; rotations are more complex and have multiple representations.

- **3D Rotations (3D_Rotations.pdf)**
  - Rotation of a rigid body in 3D space is critical for robot orientation (e.g., end-effector grasping).
  - 2D rotation example: rotating a point \( A \) on body \( B \) by angle \( \theta \) changes global coordinates via trigonometric formulas.
  - **Rotation Matrix \( R^G_B \):**
    - A 3×3 orthogonal matrix whose columns are the axes of body frame {B} expressed in global frame {G}.
    - Properties:
      - Orthogonal: \( (R^G_B)^T = (R^G_B)^{-1} \)
      - Determinant = 1 (right-handed coordinate system)
    - Represents:
      - Orientation of one frame relative to another.
      - Coordinate transformation of points between frames: \( P^1_A = R^1_2 P^2_A \).
      - Rotation of vectors within the same frame.
  - Examples of rotation matrices about principal axes:
    - About z-axis: 
      \[
      R_z(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
      \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\
      \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}
      \]
    - About y-axis and x-axis similarly defined.
  - Composition of rotations:
    - For articulated arms with multiple joints, rotation matrices multiply to get net orientation.
    - Two types of rotation composition:
      - Current frame rotations: post-multiply previous rotation.
      - Fixed frame rotations: pre-multiply previous rotation.
    - Example: For frames {0}, {1}, {2} and point \( A \),
      \[
      P^0_A = R^0_1 R^1_2 P^2_A
      \]
      where \( R^0_2 = R^0_1 R^1_2 \) (current frame).
    - Distinction matters because matrix multiplication is not commutative; order affects final orientation.
    - Rotations can be mixed between fixed and current frames but must be specified clearly.

### 3D Rotation Representations (From 3D_Rotations_pdf.pdf)

- **Rotation Matrix (RG_B):** A 3×3 orthogonal matrix whose columns are the axes of body frame {B} expressed in global frame {G}.
  - Properties: Orthogonal, determinant = 1 (right-handed coordinates), transpose equals inverse.
  - Direction cosines represent dot products of axes between frames.
- **Interpretations:**
  - Describes orientation of one frame relative to another.
  - Maps coordinates of points between frames: \( P^1_A = R^1_2 P^2_A \).
  - Rotates vectors within the same frame.
- **Examples:**
  - Rotation about z-axis by angle θ: 
    \[
    R_z(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\
    \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  - Similar matrices for rotations about x and y axes.
- **Composition of Rotations:**
  - For frames {0}, {1}, {2} with rotations \( R^0_1, R^1_2 \), the net rotation is \( R^0_2 = R^0_1 R^1_2 \) when rotations are relative to the current frame.
  - If rotations are relative to a fixed frame, premultiply: \( R^0_2 = R R^0_1 \).
  - Important to specify whether rotations are applied in current or fixed frames to avoid ambiguity.
- **Example of rotation composition:**
  - Multiple rotations \( R_a, R_b, R_c, R_d \) can be applied in any order mixing fixed/current frames but must specify frame of application.

---

### Mobile Robot Kinematics (From Mobile_Robot_Kinematics.pdf)

- **Configuration:**
  - Robot modeled as rigid body in 2D with configuration vector \( q = [x, y, \theta]^T \).
  - \( (x,y) \) is position of robot frame origin in global frame; θ is orientation angle.
- **Assumptions:**
  1. Robot is a single rigid body.
  2. Moves on smooth, flat surface.
  3. No slip between wheels and floor.
  4. Wheels spin about central axis; steering wheels rotate about vertical axis.
- **Velocities:**
  - Velocity vector \( \dot{q} = [\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\theta}]^T \).
- **Freedoms and Constraints:**
  - Degrees of freedom \( d \), freedoms \( m \leq d \), constraints \( n \leq d \).
  - Allowed motions: \( \dot{q} = \sum_i g_i(q) u_i \), where \( g_i(q) \) are motion vectors, \( u_i \) control inputs.
  - Constraints forbid motion: \( w_i(q) \cdot \dot{q} = 0 \).
- **Unicycle Model:**
  - Controls: \( u_1 \) forward speed, \( u_2 \) turning speed.
  - Freedoms:
    \[
    g_1(q) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta \\ \sin \theta \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
    g_2(q) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  - Velocity:
    \[
    \dot{q} = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \cos \theta \\ u_1 \sin \theta \\ u_2 \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  - Constraint (no sideways motion):
    \[
    w_1(q) = \begin{bmatrix} -\sin \theta \\ \cos \theta \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
    \dot{y} \cos \theta - \dot{x} \sin \theta = 0
    \]
  - Nonholonomic system: constraint cannot be integrated to a function of q only.
- **Unsteered Cart:**
  - Four fixed wheels, no steering.
  - Single control input \( u_1 \) forward speed.
  - Freedoms:
    \[
    \dot{q} = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \cos \theta \\ u_1 \sin \theta \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  - Constraints:
    \[
    w_1(q) = \begin{bmatrix} -\sin \theta \\ \cos \theta \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
    w_2(q) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    which imply:
    \[
    \dot{y} \cos \theta - \dot{x} \sin \theta = 0, \quad \dot{\theta} = 0
    \]
  - Holonomic system: constraints integrable to functions of q:
    \[
    (y - y_0) \cos \theta_0 - (x - x_0) \sin \theta_0 = 0, \quad \theta = \theta_0
    \]
- **Holonomic vs Nonholonomic:**
  - Holonomic: constraints depend only on configuration q.
  - Nonholonomic: constraints depend on velocities \( \dot{q} \) and are not integrable.
  - Unicycle is nonholonomic (2 controls, 3 DOF).
  - Unsteered cart is holonomic (1 control, 1 DOF).
- **Mobile Robot Steering Kinematics:**
  - Wheels resist sideways slip; constraints consistent if wheels parallel.
  - Instantaneous rotation center of a wheel lies on line perpendicular to wheel direction through axle.
  - Bicycle model: two wheels rigidly connected, one steerable; instantaneous rotation centers intersect at a point defining steering.
  - Unsteered cart: rotation centers parallel lines meeting at infinity → straight line motion only.
  - Skid-steered vehicles violate nonholonomic constraints by slipping sideways.
- **Differential Drive:**
  - Two wheels on common axis, control inputs are left and right wheel velocities \( v_\ell, v_r \).
  - Robot linear velocity:
    \[
    v = \frac{v_r + v_\ell}{2}
    \]
  - Angular velocity:
    \[
    \omega = \frac{v_\ell - v_r}{b}
    \]
    where b is wheel separation.
  - Curvature:
    \[
    \kappa = \frac{2(v_\ell - v_r)}{b(v_\ell + v_r)}
    \]
  - Wheel velocities from desired \( v, \omega \):
    \[
    v_\ell = v + \frac{b \omega}{2}, \quad v_r = v - \frac{b \omega}{2}
    \]
- **Ackermann Steering (Car-like):**
  - Two steerable front wheels, two fixed rear wheels.
  - Steering angle \( \alpha \), wheelbase b.
  - Angular velocity:
    \[
    \omega = \frac{v \tan \alpha}{b}
    \]
  - Steering angle from desired \( v, \omega \):
    \[
    \alpha = \text{atan2}(b \omega, v)
    \]
  - Nonlinear steering response: low near straight, increases super-linearly with angle.
- **Comparison:**
  - Ackermann steering preferred for cars due to variable sensitivity and stability.
  - Differential drive simpler but less stable at high speeds and less responsive in tight spaces.

---

**2. Rigid Motions and Homogeneous Transforms (Course Notes)**  
- **Concepts:**  
  - Rigid motion = rotation + translation.  
  - Rotation matrix \( R^G_B \) describes orientation of body frame {B} w.r.t global frame {G}.  
  - Position vector \( P^G_B \) locates origin of {B} in {G}.  
  - Point \( A \) fixed in {B} has coordinates in {G}:  
    \[
    P^G_A = R^G_B P^B_A + P^G_B
    \]  
  - Composition of rotations and translations for multiple frames:  
    \[
    R^0_2 = R^0_1 R^1_2, \quad P^0_2 = R^0_1 P^1_2 + P^0_1
    \]  
- **Homogeneous Transformation Matrix \( H \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 4} \):**  
  \[
  H = \begin{bmatrix} R & P \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
  \]  
  - Combines rotation \( R \in SO(3) \) and translation \( P \in \mathbb{R}^3 \).  
  - Allows rigid motions to be computed via matrix multiplication.  
- **Applying \( H \) to a point \( P^2_A \) in homogeneous coordinates:**  
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix} P^0_A \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = H^0_2 \begin{bmatrix} P^2_A \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
  \]  
- **Inverse of \( H \):**  
  \[
  H^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} R^T & -R^T P \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
  \]  
- **Frame transformations:**  
  - Applying motion \( H \) in current frame: \( H^0_2 = H^0_1 H \) (post-multiply).  
  - Applying motion \( H \) in fixed frame: \( H^0_2 = H H^0_1 \) (pre-multiply).  
- **Example (Document Viewer):**  
  - Given frames {0}, {1}, {2}, {3} with known relative positions and orientations, compute \( H^0_1, H^1_2, H^1_3 \) and then \( H^2_3 = (H^1_2)^{-1} H^1_3 \).  
  - Matrices constructed by inspection and dot product method for rotation matrices.  
  - Result confirms the position and orientation of the object in the camera frame.  

---

**3. Configuration Spaces (Course Notes)**  
- **Definition:**  
  - Configuration of a robot = vector of all degrees of freedom (DOF) needed to specify every particle's position.  
  - Rigid body: 6 DOF in 3D, 3 DOF in 2D.  
  - Articulated robots: joints add internal DOF; each joint typically has 1 DOF (revolute or prismatic).  
- **Configuration space (C-space):**  
  - Set of all permissible configurations, expressed as Cartesian product of variable domains.  
  - Examples:  
    - \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) for two real variables.  
    - \( S \) for angles (circle, values in \([- \pi, \pi]\)).  
    - \( S^3 \) for 3D rotations (not simply \( S \times S \times S \)).  
- **External configuration variables:**  
  - Pose of base link (usually fixed to ground or wheels).  
  - In 2D: \( \{x, y, \theta\} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \times S \).  
  - In 3D: \( \{x, y, z, \alpha, \beta, \gamma\} \in \mathbb{R}^3 \times S^3 \) (Euler angles).  
- **Internal configuration variables:**  
  - Joint angles \( \theta_i \) for revolute joints, linear displacements \( d_j \) for prismatic joints.  
  - Vector:  
    \[
    \begin{bmatrix} \theta_1 \\ \theta_2 \\ \vdots \\ \theta_n \\ d_1 \\ d_2 \\ \vdots \\ d_m \end{bmatrix} \in \prod_{i=1}^n S \times \prod_{j=1}^m \mathbb{R}
    \]  
- **Full configuration space for articulated robot:**  
  \[
  \mathbb{R}^3 \times S^3 \times \prod_{i=1}^n S \times \prod_{j=1}^m \mathbb{R}
  \]  
- **Example:** KUKA youBot robot has 3 DOF mobile base + 5 DOF arm = 8 DOF total.  
- **Actuator space, joint space, Cartesian space:**  
  - Joint space: vector of joint variables.  
  - Cartesian space: position and orientation in Euclidean space.  
  - Actuator space: positions of actuators, which may differ from joint variables due to mechanical linkages.  
  - Mappings exist between these spaces; forward kinematics maps joint space to Cartesian space.  

---

**4. Forward Kinematics for Manipulator Arms**  
- **Problem:** Given joint configuration \( q = (q_1, q_2, ..., q_n) \), find end-effector pose \( H^0_n \).  
- **Setup:**  
  - \( n \) joints, \( n+1 \) links numbered 0 to \( n \).  
  - Joint \( i \) connects link \( i-1 \) to \( i \).  
  - Each joint variable \( q_i \) is either angle \( \theta_i \) (revolute) or displacement \( d_i \) (prismatic).  
- **Frames:** Attach coordinate frame \( \{i\} \) to link \( i \).  
- **Homogeneous transforms:**  
  - \( H_i = H_i(q_i) \) gives pose of frame \( i \) relative to \( i-1 \).  
  - Forward kinematics:  
    \[
    H^0_n = H_1 H_2 \cdots H_n
    \]  
- **Note:** Frame attachment choices affect the form of \( H_i \).  

---

**CS 4750 COMBINED Foundations of Robotics (2025FA) - Summary**

**Course Materials & Content:**

- **Configuration Spaces (from Configuration_Space.pdf):**
  - A robot's configuration fully describes the position of every particle.
  - Rigid body assumption: pose (position + orientation) of a frame defines all particles in that body.
  - Articulated robots have joints allowing internal motion; each joint has 1 degree of freedom (DoF).
  - Configuration vector = list of joint values; configuration space = all permissible configurations.
  - Spaces:
    - Real numbers R for linear variables.
    - Circle S for angles (values between -π and +π).
    - 3D rotations represented by S³ (not simply S×S×S).
  - External configuration variables: pose of base link (fixed to ground or wheels).
    - 2D pose: {x, y, θ} ∈ R² × S
    - 3D pose: {x, y, z, α, β, γ} ∈ R³ × S³ (Euler angles used here).
  - Internal configuration variables: joint angles θ_i for revolute joints, linear displacements d_j for prismatic joints.
  - Example: KUKA youBot has 3 DoF base + 5 DoF arm = 8 DoF total.
  - Actuator space, joint space, Cartesian space:
    - Actuator space: sensor readings at actuators.
    - Joint space: joint variables vector q ∈ ℝⁿ or Sⁿ.
    - Cartesian space: position and orientation of end-effector in task space.
  - Mappings between actuator, joint, and Cartesian spaces are key; forward kinematics maps joint space → Cartesian space.

- **Forward Kinematics for Manipulator Arms:**
  - Problem: Given joint configuration q = (q₁, q₂, ..., q_n), find end-effector pose.
  - Joints considered have 1 DoF: revolute (angle θ_i) or prismatic (linear displacement d_i).
  - Numbering convention:
    - n joints numbered 1 to n.
    - n+1 links numbered 0 to n; joint i connects link i-1 to i.
    - Link 0 fixed to base, not actuated.
  - Attach coordinate frame {i} to link i.
  - Homogeneous transform H_i(q_i) gives pose of frame {i} relative to {i-1}.
  - Forward kinematics transform:
    - H₀ⁿ(q₁,...,q_n) = H₁(q₁) H₂(q₂) ... H_n(q_n)
    - Each H_i has form:
      ```
      H_i = [ R_{i-1}^i  P_{i-1}^i
              0          1       ]
      ```
    - H₀ⁿ gives rotation R₀ⁿ and position P₀ⁿ of end-effector relative to base.
  - Frame placement on links affects the form of H_i; no unique correct set of transforms.
  - Next steps include solving example problems for industrial robots.

**General Approach to Solving Probability Problems (from supplemental material):**

1. Read problem carefully; identify random variables/events.
2. Define notation, distributions, and parameters explicitly.
3. Write down given probabilities (marginal, joint, conditional).
4. Write down given distribution properties (expectations, variances).
5. Express what is asked mathematically; define new variables if needed.
6. Solve the resulting math problem.

Example problems illustrate defining random variables and computing probabilities stepwise.

**ECON 3130 - Module 5: More Random Variables (Lecture 2, Sept 22, 2025)**

**Topics Covered:**
- Review of Poisson distribution
- Introduction to Exponential and Gamma distributions
- Binomial, Geometric, and Negative Binomial distributions

**Poisson Distribution:**
- Defined by parameter λ (rate of occurrences per unit time).
- Conditions: independent counts in nonoverlapping intervals; probability of one occurrence in short interval ≈ λh; probability of two or more ≈ 0.
- PMF: \( P(X=k) = e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^k}{k!} \), \( k \geq 0 \).
- Mean and variance: \( E[X] = Var[X] = \lambda \).
- Example: Defective bulbs in a 100-bulb string with 2% defect rate. Use Poisson approximation with λ = 2. Probability no more than 3 defective bulbs is approximately 0.76 (option C).

**Exponential Distribution:**
- Models time until first event in a Poisson process with rate λ.
- Continuous random variable \( W \geq 0 \).
- CDF: \( F(w) = 0 \) for \( w < 0 \), \( F(w) = 1 - e^{-\lambda w} \) for \( w \geq 0 \).
- Mean and variance: \( E[W] = 1/\lambda \), \( Var[W] = 1/\lambda^2 \).
- Example: Time until first patient arrives at a drop-in clinic with average λ patients/hour.

**Binomial, Geometric, Negative Binomial Distributions:**
- Binomial(n=40, p=0.2): number of wins in 40 games.
- Geometric(p=0.2): number of games until first win.
- Negative Binomial(r=5, p=0.2): number of games until 5 wins.

**Gamma Distribution:**
- Models time until the α-th event in a Poisson process with rate λ.
- PDF: \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha) \theta^\alpha} x^{\alpha - 1} e^{-x/\theta} \), \( x \geq 0 \), where \( \theta = 1/\lambda \).
- Mean and variance: \( E[X] = \alpha \theta \), \( Var[X] = \alpha \theta^2 \).
- Gamma function defined as \( \Gamma(t) = \int_0^\infty y^{t-1} e^{-y} dy \), with property \( \Gamma(t) = (t-1) \Gamma(t-1) \) for \( t > 1 \), and \( \Gamma(1) = 1 \).
- For positive integers \( n \), \( \Gamma(n) = (n-1)! \).
- CDF expressed via Poisson probabilities: \( F(x) = 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{\alpha - 1} \frac{(\lambda x)^k e^{-\lambda x}}{k!} \).
- Special case: \( X \sim \text{Gamma}(1, \theta) \) is Exponential distribution.
- Applications: modeling times until multiple events (customers, bankruptcies), treatment costs, climate change economic costs.

**Example Problem:**
- Sally walks through a monster nest spawning monsters at rate 12/hour for 15 minutes.
- Probability she catches at least 3 monsters before class can be modeled using Poisson or Gamma distributions.

**Upcoming Schedule:**

---

**Summary of Key Formulas and Concepts:**

- Poisson PMF: \( P(X=k) = e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^k}{k!} \)
- Exponential CDF: \( F(w) = 1 - e^{-\lambda w} \)
- Gamma PDF: \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha) \theta^\alpha} x^{\alpha - 1} e^{-x/\theta} \)
- Gamma function recursion: \( \Gamma(t) = (t-1) \Gamma(t-1) \), \( \Gamma(1) = 1 \)
- Mean/Variance: Poisson \( \lambda \), Exponential \( 1/\lambda, 1/\lambda^2 \), Gamma \( \alpha \theta, \alpha \theta^2 \)

---

### Lecture Content Highlights (Module 5, Lecture 1: More Random Variables)

**Binomial Random Variables:**  
- Features: n independent trials, two outcomes per trial, constant success probability p.  
- PMF: \( f(x; n, p) = \binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} \), x = 0,...,n.  
- Example question: Probability a man guessing coin flips (10 flips, 8 correct) would do at least this well by chance? Options: 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20.

**Negative Binomial Random Variables:**  
- Features: sequence of independent trials, two outcomes, constant success probability p.  
- X ~ NegBin(r, p): number of trials to get exactly r successes.  
- PMF: \( f(x; r, p) = \binom{x-1}{r-1} p^r (1-p)^{x-r} \), x ≥ r.  
- Mean: \( E[X] = \frac{r}{p} \), Variance: \( \frac{r(1-p)}{p^2} \).  
- Example: Cal Raleigh hit 54 home runs in 147 games; expected games to reach 73 home runs? Options: 26, 36, 52, 56, 66.  
- Example: Expected number of cereal boxes to buy to get all 4 different prizes? Options: 16, 8 1/3, 8, 4.

**Geometric Random Variables:**  
- Special case of Negative Binomial with r=1.  
- PMF: \( f(x; p) = p (1-p)^{x-1} \), x ≥ 1.  
- Mean: \( 1/p \), Variance: \( (1-p)/p^2 \).

**Poisson Random Variables:**  
- Models count of occurrences in fixed interval with rate λ.  
- Conditions for Poisson process: independent counts in disjoint intervals, probability of one occurrence in short interval ≈ λh, probability of two or more in short interval ≈ 0.  
- PMF: \( P(X=k) = e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^k}{k!} \), k ≥ 0.  
- Mean and variance both equal λ.  
- Poisson can be derived as limit of Binomial(n, λ/n) as n→∞.  
- Valid PMF because probabilities ≥ 0 and sum to 1 (sum of Poisson PMF over k is \( e^{-\lambda} e^{\lambda} = 1 \)).

---

### The Gamma Function and Distribution (from earlier lecture notes)

- Gamma function: \( \Gamma(t) = \int_0^\infty y^{t-1} e^{-y} dy \), for t > 0.  
- Recursion: \( \Gamma(t) = (t-1) \Gamma(t-1) \) for t > 1, and \( \Gamma(1) = 1 \).  
- For positive integers n, \( \Gamma(n) = (n-1)! \).  
- Gamma distribution \( \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \theta) \) models waiting time until the α-th event in a Poisson process with rate \( 1/\theta \).  
- PDF: \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha) \theta^\alpha} x^{\alpha -1} e^{-x/\theta} \), for \( x \geq 0 \).  
- Mean: \( E[X] = \alpha \theta \), Variance: \( \alpha \theta^2 \).  
- When α is integer, Gamma distribution relates to sum of α exponential variables.  
- CDF relates to Poisson probabilities: \( F(x) = 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{\alpha -1} \frac{(\lambda x)^k e^{-\lambda x}}{k!} \) where \( \lambda = 1/\theta \).  
- Special case: Gamma(1, θ) = Exponential(θ).  
- Applications: modeling time until r-th customer arrival, treatment costs, risk-neutral option valuations, climate change economic costs.

---

### Example Application Problem

- Sally walks through a monster nest spawning monsters at rate 12/hour.  
- Trip through nest takes 15 minutes.  
- Question: Probability she catches at least 3 monsters before class?  
- Model: Number of monsters caught ~ Poisson(3) (since 12/hour × 0.25 hour = 3 expected).  
- Time until 3rd monster caught ~ Gamma(3, 1/12).

---

**ECON 3130 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics: Module 4, Lecture 2 - Normal Random Variables (Sept 15, 2025)**

**Key Concepts:**

- **Continuous Random Variables & PDFs:**  
  For continuous RV \(X\), probability \(P(a < X < b)\) is the area under the pdf between \(a\) and \(b\). The cumulative distribution function (cdf) \(F(a) = P(X \leq a) = \int_{-\infty}^a f(x) dx\).

- **Normal Distribution:**  
  Defined by pdf:  
  \[
  f(x; \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
  \]  
  Notation: \(X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)\).  
  - Mean \(E(X) = \mu\)  
  - Variance \(Var(X) = \sigma^2\)  
  - Standard deviation \(SD(X) = \sigma\)  
  - Standard normal: \(Z \sim N(0,1)\)

- **Examples of (Approx.) Normal Variables:**  
  - Monthly returns of S&P 500  
  - Adult height (e.g., Mexican Family Life Survey: mean 62.4", SD 3.87")  
  - Log quarterly expenditures of US households  
  - Manufacturing errors, exam grades, log firm sizes, crop yields, etc.

- **Properties of Normal Distribution:**  
  - 68% of outcomes within 1 SD of mean  
  - 95% within 2 SD  
  - 99.7% within 3 SD  
  - Sum of independent normal RVs is normal  
  - Linear transformations of normal RVs remain normal  
  - Standardizing: \(Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1)\)

- **Calculating Probabilities:**  
  - Probability \(P(a < X < b) = \int_a^b f(x) dx\)  
  - Use standard normal tables (Z-tables) or software functions:  
    - Stata: `normal(z)` for \(P(Z < z)\)  
    - Excel: `NORMDIST(x, μ, σ, TRUE)`  
  - Example: Probability adult male taller than 6 feet  
  - Example: IQ distribution \(N(100, 15^2)\), fraction with IQ > 150 is about 0.0004

- **Moment Generating Function (MGF):**  
  \[
  M(t) = E[e^{tX}] = \exp\left(\mu t + \frac{\sigma^2 t^2}{2}\right)
  \]

- **Quantiles:**  
  The \(p\)-th quantile \(x_p\) satisfies \(P(X \leq x_p) = p\).  
  Example: 95th percentile IQ = 125 (since \(Z_{0.95} = 1.645\)).

---

**Problem Set / Exercises:**

- **Optimal Grocer Problem:**  
  Number of customers \(X \sim U(0,200)\) (uniform).  
  Profit per watermelon sold: $1.  
  Loss per unhappy customer (if demand > supply): $5 goodwill loss each.  
  Loss per surplus watermelon: $0.50 each.  
  Tasks:  
  1. Write profit \(\pi(n,X)\) as piecewise function of \(n\) (watermelons brought) and \(X\).  
  2. Write expected profit \(E[\pi(n,X)]\) as function of \(n\).  
  3. Find \(n\) maximizing expected profit.

- **Lost Packages Problem:**  
  Delivery time \(X \sim N(22, 2^2)\) hours if not lost; 2% packages lost.  
  1. Probability package not delivered after 26.5 hours?  
  2. Given package not delivered after 26.5 hours, probability it is lost?

**ECON 3130 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics**

**Module 2: Probabilities and Events (Lecture Date: August 27, 2025)**

- **Goals:** Review set theory basics, understand probability paradigm, distinguish marginal, joint, conditional probabilities, and use probability tables.

- **Key Terminology:**
  - Experiment: process with uncertain outcomes.
  - Outcome: possible result of experiment.
  - Sample space: all possible outcomes.
  - Event: subset of sample space.
  - Probability: numerical measure of event likelihood (0 to 1).

- **Probability Concepts:**
  - Relative frequency interpretation: probability as fraction of times event occurs in repeated trials.
  - Subjective probability: degree of belief about uncertain events.
  
- **Example: Balls and Urns Problem**
  - Urn A: 3 orange, 2 green balls.
  - Urn B: 15 orange, 10 green balls.
  - Question: Which urn offers better chance of winning $1,000,000 by drawing an orange ball? (Answer: Both have same probability 3/5 = 15/25 = 0.6)

- **Probability Distributions and Tables:**
  - Probability distribution: table listing probabilities of all basic outcomes summing to 1.
  - Example: Pet preference distribution (Dog 0.44, Cat 0.30, Other 0.07, None 0.19).
  - Probability tables summarize joint probabilities of two attributes (e.g., Gender and Pet preference).
  - Marginal probabilities: sums of rows or columns.
  - Joint probabilities: probabilities of combined events (e.g., P(Dog and Male)).

- **Venn Diagrams and Set Theory:**
  - Visualize events and their intersections/unions.
  - Probability rules:
    - Intersection: P(A and B).
    - Union: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).
    - Complement: P(not A) = 1 - P(A).

- **Conditional Probability:**
  - Definition: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).
  - Multiplication rule: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).
  - Example: Probability preferred pet is dog given female.

- **Problem Breaks:**
  - Given data on Pokemon Go and Netflix usage among freshmen, construct probability tables and calculate probabilities (e.g., probability of doing neither).
  - Birthday problem: Probability at least two students share a birthday in a class of 50.
  - Drug test problem: Given prevalence and test accuracy, find probability a positive test is false positive.

- **Assignments and Deadlines:**
  - Module 2 quiz due next day after lecture.
  - Pre-assessments due Friday night.
  - Friday section: practice probability problems.
  - Encouragement to start first problem set early.

---

**Module 4, Lecture 2: Normal Random Variables (September 15, 2025)**

- **Normal Distribution:**
  - Defined by mean (μ) and variance (σ²).
  - PDF formula: \( f(x; \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \).
  - Standard normal: μ=0, σ=1, denoted Z.
  - Examples of approximately normal variables: adult height, S&P 500 monthly returns, log household income.

- **Properties:**
  1. Sum of independent normal r.v.s is normal.
  2. Linear transformations of normal r.v.s remain normal.
  3. Standardizing: \( Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1) \).

- **Calculating Probabilities:**
  - Probability \( P(a < X < b) = \int_a^b f(x) dx \).
  - Use standard normal tables (Z-tables) for \( P(Z < z) \).
  - Symmetry: \( P(Z > z) = 1 - P(Z < z) \).
  - Examples:
    - Probability adult male taller than 6 feet.
    - Probability woman in Mexico under 4'2" (converted to inches).
    - IQ distribution: mean 100, SD 15; fraction with IQ > 150 is about 0.0004.
    - 95th percentile IQ: about 125.

- **Methods to Calculate Normal Probabilities:**
  - Old school: Z-tables.
  - New school: software functions:
    - Stata: normal(x) for standard normal.
    - Excel: NORMDIST(x, μ, σ, 1).

- **Moment Generating Function (mgf) of Normal:**
  - \( M(t) = E[e^{tX}] = \exp(\mu t + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 t^2) \).

- **Example Problem: Lost Packages**
  - Delivery time between Chicago and New York ~ N(22, 2²) hours if not lost.
  - 2% packages lost.
  - Q1: Probability package not arrived after 26.5 hours?
    - \( P(X > 26.5) = 0.02 + 0.98 \times P(X > 26.5 | \text{not lost}) \approx 0.032 \).
  - Q2: Given package not arrived after 26.5 hours, probability it is lost?
    - Use Bayes' theorem with above probabilities.

The user is enrolled in the following class: GLOBAL 76384

Starting summary for GLOBAL 76384:

**Chapter 1: Questions about Questions (Mostly Harmless Econometrics excerpt)**
- Emphasizes the importance of a coherent research agenda centered on causal questions.
- Four key FAQs for research design:
  1. What is the causal relationship of interest? (e.g., effect of schooling on wages)
  2. What is the ideal experiment to identify this causal effect? (often hypothetical)
  3. What is the identification strategy using observational data? (e.g., natural experiments)
  4. What is the mode of statistical inference? (population, sample, assumptions)
- Discusses challenges in causal inference, such as "Fundamentally Unidentified Questions" (FUQ), e.g., causal effects of race or gender.
- Highlights the role of imagination in research design but notes limits when variables are deterministically linked.
- Introduces the importance of credible identification strategies and the role of natural experiments.
- Quotes Trygve Haavelmo on the importance of experimental design in economics.
- Notes that statistical inference details, though technical, are crucial for project success.

**Chapter 2: The Experimental Ideal**
- Randomized experiments are the gold standard for causal inference.
- Example: Perry Preschool Project (1962) - randomized early intervention with long-term follow-up, influencing Head Start programs.
- Selection problem illustrated via hospital treatment example: naive comparisons confound treatment effect with selection bias.
- Formalizes potential outcomes framework: each individual has y1 (if treated) and y0 (if untreated); only one observed.
- Selection bias arises when treatment assignment correlates with potential outcomes.
- Random assignment breaks this correlation, eliminating selection bias.
- Examples where non-experimental studies misled (e.g., hormone replacement therapy, job training programs).
- Tennessee STAR experiment: randomized class size to estimate effect on student achievement.
  - Design: 3 treatments (small classes 13-17 students, regular classes 22-25 with/without aide).
  - Randomization balanced student characteristics (race, age, free lunch status).
  - Results: small classes improved test scores by ~5-6 percentile points (~0.2 standard deviations).
  - Regression analysis confirms causal effect; inclusion of covariates (school fixed effects, student characteristics) improves precision but does not bias estimates.
- Regression is a key tool for analyzing experimental and quasi-experimental data.
- Quasi-experiments (e.g., Angrist and Lavy 1999 on class size caps in Israel) can approximate randomized trials.
- Regression models with fixed effects and controls reduce residual variance and standard errors.
- Teacher characteristics had little effect on student achievement in STAR data.
- Emphasizes that regression estimates causal effects only if selection bias is eliminated or controlled.

**NBER Working Paper: Doctors' and Nurses' Social Media Ads Reduced Holiday Travel and COVID-19 Infections: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (Breza et al., 2021)**

- **Study Objective:** Test if short video messages by clinicians on Facebook can reduce holiday travel and COVID-19 infections.
- **Design:** Two-stage cluster RCT in 820 counties across 13 US states.
  - Counties randomized to high-intensity (75% zip codes treated) or low-intensity (25% zip codes treated).
  - Ads sent to Facebook users in treated zip codes before Thanksgiving and Christmas 2020.
- **Intervention:** 20-second videos recorded by diverse physicians and nurses urging viewers to stay home for holidays.
- **Sample Size:** 
  - Thanksgiving: ~11.95 million users received ads.
  - Christmas: ~23.3 million users received ads.
- **Primary Outcomes:**
  1. County-level holiday travel measured by Facebook mobile phone location data.
  2. Zip code-level COVID-19 infection counts from state health data.
- **Results:**
  - Travel: High-intensity counties reduced average distance traveled by ~0.99 percentage points in 3 days before holidays (p=0.002).
  - No significant effect on share leaving home on holiday day.
  - COVID-19 cases: Treated zip codes had 3.5% fewer cases in the two weeks starting 5 days post-holiday (p=0.013).
- **Randomization and Analysis:**
  - Randomization done with Stata; analysis by intention-to-treat.
  - County-level mobility analyzed via OLS regression controlling for baseline values.

**Course Summary: Study on Doctors' and Nurses' Social Media Ads Impact on Holiday Travel and COVID-19 Infections**

**Study Overview:**
- A large-scale cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) tested whether short video messages by doctors and nurses, disseminated via Facebook ads, reduced holiday travel and COVID-19 infections.
- Conducted in 820 counties across 13 U.S. states during Thanksgiving and Christmas 2020.
- Two-stage randomization:
  - Counties assigned to high-intensity (H) or low-intensity (L) groups.
  - Within H counties, 75% of zip codes treated; within L counties, 25% treated.
- Ads reached 11.95 million users at Thanksgiving and 23.3 million at Christmas.
- Videos encouraged staying home for holidays; scripts included physician/nurse introduction and urging to stay safe.

**Trial Design & Methods:**
- IRB approved by MIT; Harvard, Yale, MGH ceded authority.
- Facebook provided ad credits and policy review but no role in design or analysis.
- Mobility data from Facebook users’ mobile location (county-level).
- COVID-19 case data collected at zip code level from state health websites.
- Primary outcomes:
  1. Holiday travel (distance traveled and share leaving home).
  2. COVID-19 infections in the two-week period starting 5 days post-holiday.
- Statistical analysis:
  - County-level mobility compared H vs. L counties using OLS regression (Eq. 1).
  - Zip code-level COVID-19 cases analyzed with inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (Eq. 2).
  - Standard errors clustered; randomization inference p-values computed.
- Sample size powered to detect small effect sizes (0.2 SD for counties, ~0.06 SD for zip codes).

**Sample Details:**
- Thanksgiving: 820 counties, 6,998 zip codes after exclusions.
- Christmas: 767 counties (excluded 60 rural, heavily Republican counties), 6,716 zip codes.
- Baseline: ~36% Democrats, 62% Republicans; ~46-49% urban zip codes.
- Baseline mobility ~8.7-8.9% lower than Feb 2020; ~82% left home on Nov 13, 2020.

**Key Results:**

*Mobility Outcomes (Table 2):*
- Distance traveled 3 days before holidays decreased by 0.993 percentage points more in high-intensity counties vs. low-intensity (p=0.002).
- Thanksgiving: -0.924 pp (p=0.035); Christmas: -1.041 pp (p=0.011).
- No significant effect on share leaving home on the holiday itself (adjusted difference 0.030, p=0.881).

*COVID-19 Cases (Table 3):*
- Fortnightly COVID-19 cases starting 5 days post-holiday reduced by 3.5% in treated zip codes vs. controls (adjusted difference in asinh cases = -0.035, p=0.013).
- Christmas effect stronger (-4.2%, p=0.007) than Thanksgiving (-2.7%, p=0.097).
- Effects robust to alternative zero-case handling and consistent across quantiles.
- No significant pre-intervention differences in cases between treated and control zip codes.

*Heterogeneity:*
- No significant differences in effects by political leaning (Republican vs. Democrat), urban vs. rural status, or their interaction.
- Smaller effects on COVID-19 cases in counties with high baseline infection rates.
- Excluded 60 rural, heavily Republican counties from Christmas campaign due to concerns about backlash.

**Intervention Details:**
- Videos (~20 seconds) recorded by diverse physicians and nurses.
- Thanksgiving script: Urged staying home, mask-wearing if visiting.
- Christmas script similar with minor variations.
- Ads delivered 3-5 times per user on average.
- Engagement rates: ~12-13% watched at least 3 seconds, exceeding industry benchmarks.

**Limitations:**
- Study limited to Facebook users; may not generalize to other media.
- Only one message type tested; effects might differ with other messengers or formats.
- Mobility data only captures travel away from home, not return.
- Potential underestimation of COVID-19 effect due to geographic proximity of treated and control zip codes.

**Conclusions:**
- Clinician-recorded social media messages effectively reduced holiday travel and subsequent COVID-19 infections.
- No evidence of political polarization in response.
- Demonstrates potential for health professionals to influence public health behavior at scale via social media.
- Suggests future research on similar campaigns to promote vaccination uptake.

**Module 3: Discrete Random Variables (Fall 2025)**

**Readings:**
- HTZ: Chapter 2.1-2.4

**Topics Covered:**
- Probability mass functions (pmf)
- Moments: mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis
- Moment-generating functions (mgf)
- Bernoulli and Binomial random variables

**Lectures:**
- Sept 3, 2025: Introduction to discrete random variables, independence, probability trees, random variables, measures of central tendency and dispersion, conditional expectations, Law of Iterated Expectations.
- Sept 8, 2025: Moments, moment generating functions, Bernoulli and Binomial random variables.

**Discussion Section:**
- Sept 5, 2025

**Key Concepts and Details:**

1. **Independence and Conditional Probability:**
   - Two events A and B are independent iff Pr(A and B) = Pr(A)*Pr(B).
   - If independent, then Pr(A|B) = Pr(A).
   - Mutually exclusive events with non-zero probability are not independent.

2. **Probability Trees:**
   - Visual tool for sequential conditional probabilities.
   - Branches represent outcomes with conditional probabilities.
   - Joint probabilities are products along branches.
   - Examples: two independent coin tosses, birthday problem.

3. **Monte Hall Problem:**
   - Three doors: one with a car, two with goats.
   - After initial choice, host reveals a goat behind one unchosen door.
   - Contestant can stay or switch.
   - Probability of winning if switching is 2/3.
   - Probability tree analysis confirms this.

4. **Random Variables:**
   - Numerical outcomes of experiments.
   - Denoted by capital letters (X, Y).
   - Probability Mass Function (pmf): f(x) = Pr(X=x).
   - Measures of central tendency:
     - Expected value: E[X] = Σ x * f(x)
     - Mode: value(s) with highest probability
     - Median: value x with P(X ≤ x) ≥ 0.5 and P(X ≥ x) ≥ 0.5

5. **Measures of Dispersion:**
   - Variance: Var[X] = E[(X - E[X])²] = Σ (x - E[X])² * f(x)
   - Standard deviation: SD[X] = sqrt(Var[X])
   - E[X - E[X]] = 0 by definition.

6. **Conditional Expectations:**
   - E[X|Y=y] = Σ (value of X) * Pr(X|Y=y)
   - Law of Iterated Expectations: E[E[X|Y]] = E[X]

7. **Moments:**
   - Moments are expected values of powers of random variables.
   - First moment (mean), second moment (variance), third (skewness), fourth (kurtosis).
   - Centered moments subtract mean before raising to power.
   - Standardized moments divide centered moments by SD^k.
   - Skewness measures asymmetry; kurtosis measures tail heaviness.

8. **Moment-Generating Functions (mgf):**
   - Defined as M_X(t) = E[e^{tX}] = Σ e^{tx} * f(x)
   - If two random variables have the same mgf, they have the same distribution.
   - mgf can be used to compute moments by differentiation at t=0.

9. **Bernoulli Random Variables:**
   - X = 1 with probability p (success), 0 with probability 1-p (failure).
   - E[X] = p
   - Var[X] = p(1-p)
   - mgf: M_X(t) = p e^{t} + (1-p)

10. **Binomial Random Variables:**
    - Number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials with success probability p.
    - pmf: Pr(X=k) = C(n,k) p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
    - E[X] = np
    - Var[X] = np(1-p)
    - Examples: stock market up days, airline overbooking, customer purchases.
    - Calculations can be done via binomial formula, Stata (binomialp), or Excel (BINOMDIST).

**ECON 3130 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics**

**Lecture Topics & Concepts:**

- **Discrete Random Variables:**
  - Definitions: Random variable (rv), pmf (probability mass function).
  - Measures of central tendency: Expected value \( E[X] = \sum_{x \in S} x \cdot f(x) \), mode, median.
  - Measures of dispersion: Variance \( Var[X] = E[(X - E[X])^2] = \sum_{x \in S} (x - E[X])^2 f(x) \), standard deviation.
  - Conditional expectations: \( E[X|Y=y] = \sum_x x \cdot Pr(X=x|Y=y) \).
  - Law of Iterated Expectations.
  - Independence of events: \( Pr(A \cap B) = Pr(A) \cdot Pr(B) \), and \( Pr(A|B) = Pr(A) \) if independent.
  - Probability trees for sequential events.
  - Monte Hall problem: Probability of winning if switching is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

- **Moments and Moment-Generating Functions (MGF):**
  - Moments: Expected values of powers of rv, e.g., mean (1st moment), variance (2nd centered moment).
  - MGF: \( M_t = E[e^{tX}] = \sum_x e^{tx} f(x) \).
  - MGF properties: If two rvs have same MGF, they have same distribution.
  - Use MGF derivatives at 0 to find moments: \( M'(0) = E[X] \), \( M''(0) = E[X^2] \).

- **Bernoulli and Binomial Random Variables:**
  - Bernoulli rv: \( X = 1 \) with probability \( p \), 0 otherwise.
    - \( E[X] = p \), \( Var[X] = p(1-p) \).
    - MGF: \( M_t = p e^t + (1-p) \).
  - Binomial rv: Number of successes in \( n \) independent Bernoulli trials.
    - PMF: \( Pr(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \).
    - \( E[X] = np \), \( Var[X] = np(1-p) \).
  - Example: Probability stock price is up 2 out of 4 days with \( p=0.6 \) is \( 6 \times (0.6)^2 (0.4)^2 = 0.3456 \).

(a) Show \( f(x) \) is a valid pdf:  
- \( f(x) > 0 \) on (0,1).  
- Integral over (0,1) equals 1:  
  \(\int_0^1 a x^{a-1} dx = a \times \frac{1^a - 0^a}{a} = 1\).

P = \binom{5}{0} (0.5)^0 (0.5)^5 + \binom{5}{1} (0.5)^1 (0.5)^4 = (1 + 5) \times 0.03125 = 0.1875
\]

(d) Unknown grade, applying to 3 jobs, probability of no offers:  
\[
P(0) = 0.7 \times (0.5)^3 + 0.2 \times (0.75)^3 + 0.1 \times (0.9)^3 = 0.2448
\]

(e) Number of jobs \( n \) to apply to for ≥95% chance of at least one offer:  
Solve for \( n \) such that  
\[
(0.7)(0.5)^n + (0.2)(0.75)^n + (0.1)(0.9)^n < 0.05
\]  
By trial:  
- \( n=8 \to 0.066 \) (close)  
- \( n=9 \to 0.055 \)  
- \( n=10 \to 0.047 \) (meets criterion)  
So, apply to at least 10 jobs.
