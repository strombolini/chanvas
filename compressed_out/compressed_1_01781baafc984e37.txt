### Technical Content Highlights

- **Mobile Robot Kinematics Notes:**  
  - Differential drive and bicycle models govern robot motion via control inputs (wheel velocities, steering angles)  
  - Kinematic equations relate inputs to configuration space motion  

- **Homogeneous Transforms Lecture (9/18):**  
  - HW 2.1 out now (due 10/8), HW 2.2 out 9/25 (due 10/22)  
  - Orientation representations: SO(3) rotation matrices (R ∈ R³×³, R^T R = I, det(R) = +1), Euler angles (intrinsic Z-Y'-X'' and extrinsic Z-Y-X), axis-angle, quaternions (unit norm)  
  - Robot pick-and-place requires precise coordinate frame transformations  

- **Rigid Motions and Homogeneous Transforms:**  
  - Rigid body motion preserves distances and angles  
  - Rigid transform = rotation R ∈ SO(3) + translation t ∈ R³  
  - Homogeneous coordinates unify rotation and translation in 4×4 matrices  
  - Essential for forward kinematics and coordinate frame transformations
