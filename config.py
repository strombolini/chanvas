=== TECHNICAL CONTENT EXCERPTS ===

From Mobile Robot Kinematics Notes:
"FOUNDATIONS OF ROBOTICS CS 4750, CS 5750, MAE 4760, ECE 4770 Course Notes by TAPOMAYUKH BHATTACHARJEE AND PRESTON CULBERTSON. These course notes were written and/or adapted and organized by the course staff from a mix of original sources cited throughout as well as previous course notes prepared by Ross A. Knepper, Christoforos Mavrogiannis, Julia Proft, and Wil Thomason. Many mobile robots can be modeled using differential drive or bicycle models. The kinematic equations govern the relationship between control inputs (wheel velocities or steering angles) and the robot's motion in its configuration space."

From Homogeneous Transforms Lecture (9/18):
"Homogeneous transforms - Announcements: HW 2.1 out now, due 10/8 - HW 2.2 out 9/25, due 10/22 - Hardware pick up today, after class. Last time: orientation representations - SO(3) - R ∈ R³×³ R^T R = I det(R) = +1 - not compact - Euler angles - (α, β, γ) - singular configurations - axis-angle representation - composition is complex - quaternions q:(w, x, y, z) ||q||² = 1. Euler rotations: i) intrinsic (Z-Y'-X'') - R_E = R_z(α) • R_y(β) • R_x(γ) ii) extrinsic-backwards (Z-Y-X) - R_E = R_x(γ) R_y(β) R_z(α). Robot pick-and-place operations require precise coordinate frame transformations."

From Rigid Motions and Homogeneous Transforms:
"RIGID MOTIONS AND HOMOGENEOUS TRANSFORMS - Rigid body motion preserves distances and angles between points. A rigid transformation consists of a rotation R ∈ SO(3) and a translation t ∈ R³. Homogeneous coordinates provide a unified framework for representing both rotations and translations in a single 4×4 matrix. This representation is essential for forward kinematics calculations in robot manipulators and for coordinate frame transformations in mobile robotics applications."

=== COURSE ANNOUNCEMENTS ===
